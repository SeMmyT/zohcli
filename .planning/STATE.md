## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 6 phases derived from 64 requirements (auth -> admin users/groups -> admin domains/audit -> mail read -> mail send/settings/admin -> CLI polish)
- Roadmap: UX infrastructure (output modes, exit codes, rate limiter) placed in Phase 1 since all commands depend on it
- Roadmap: Mail read (Phase 4) depends only on Phase 1, not Phase 3 -- can parallelize with admin domains/audit
- 01-01: Go 1.24 required for lipgloss v2 (auto-upgraded from 1.22)
- 01-01: FormatterProvider wrapper for Kong interface binding (Kong can't bind interfaces directly)
- 01-01: Empty region default resolves to 'us' in BeforeApply (CLI flag > config > us)
- 01-02: 99designs/keyring for OS credential storage (macOS, Linux, Windows support)
- 01-02: AES-256-GCM encrypted file fallback for WSL/headless (sha256 key derivation, future: scrypt/argon2)
- 01-02: Zoho OAuth2 quirks: comma-separated scopes, access_type=offline, prompt=consent
- 01-02: gofrs/flock for file-locked token cache (prevents concurrent refresh stampede)
- 01-02: 5-minute proactive token refresh window (reduces auth errors during API calls)
- [Phase 01-03]: 25 req/min rate limit budget (under Zoho's 30 req/min limit) — Safety margin for API calls
- [Phase 01-03]: Global --region flag instead of command-specific override — Avoids duplicate flags, cleaner UX
- [Phase 02-01]: AdminClient caches organization ID on initialization — Zoho admin APIs require zoid in URLs, fetching once avoids redundant API calls
- [Phase 02-01]: Generic PageIterator with type parameter — Go 1.24 generics enable reusable pagination for users, groups, and future resources
- [Phase 02-01]: GetUserByEmail iterates all users — Zoho API lacks email-based lookup, PageIterator makes this efficient
- [Phase 02-01]: newAdminClient helper in admin_users.go — Mirrors auth.go pattern (secrets store → token cache → client)
- [Phase 02-01]: ZUID vs email auto-detection in CLI — Better UX, users can use "zoh admin users get 12345" or "user@example.com" without flags
- [Phase 02-02]: resolveUserID returns both ZUID and User object — Commands need ZUID for API calls AND user email for confirmation messages, single lookup instead of two API calls
- [Phase 02-02]: os.Stderr for confirmation messages — Matches pattern from admin_groups.go and configcmd.go, status messages to stderr, data to stdout
- [Phase 02-02]: Delete requires --confirm flag — Deletion is permanent, prevent accidental data loss
- [Phase 02-03]: Batch size of 50 for AddGroupMembers — Provides safety margin for Zoho API bulk operation limits while maintaining efficiency
- [Phase 02-03]: ShowMembers default true in groups get — Members are core to group utility, better UX to show by default with opt-out flag
- [Phase 02-03]: Required --confirm for group deletion — Kong's required flag ensures explicit user intent for permanent destructive action
- [Phase 03-01]: Domain list does not use pagination — API returns all domains in single response (typical orgs have <10 domains)
- [Phase 03-01]: Boolean fields display raw true/false values — output.Column doesn't support Transform field (planned feature not yet implemented)
- [Phase 03-01]: User-friendly flag mappings — CLI flags (txt/cname/html, enable-hosting/etc) mapped to API mode values in command layer
- [Phase 03-01]: Verification codes printed to stderr — Ensures users see critical DNS setup info regardless of output mode
- [Phase 03-01]: Validation in AdminClient methods — Method/mode validation happens before API call for better error messages
- [Phase 03-02]: Display structs for timestamp formatting — Column type doesn't support Transform field, pre-formatting is cleaner than reflection-based changes
- [Phase 03-02]: 90-day validation in AdminClient — Login history API limitation, fail fast with clear error vs cryptic API response
- [Phase 03-02]: Informational commands for sessions/security — No documented API endpoints, web console redirect provides better UX than "not implemented"
- [Phase 03-02]: Empty string enum default — Kong requires default value for optional enums, allows --search-by to be truly optional
- [Phase 04-01]: MailClient caches primary accountID on initialization (mirrors AdminClient's cached zoid pattern)
- [Phase 04-01]: All mail requests use DoMail (MailBase URL) instead of Do (APIBase URL) - fundamental architectural difference from AdminClient
- [Phase 04-01]: Display structs for timestamp formatting (unix ms to human-readable) - Column doesn't support Transform field
- [Phase 04-01]: Three-tier message retrieval: GetMessageMetadata + GetMessageContent = complete view (two API calls)
- [Phase 04-02]: SearchQuery builder uses method chaining for fluent API construction
- [Phase 04-02]: GetThread uses client-side filtering with configurable scan limit (no dedicated API endpoint)
- [Phase 04-02]: DownloadAttachment streams binary response with io.Copy (no memory buffering)
- [Phase 04-02]: Auto-filename detection for downloads via ListAttachments lookup when --output-path not specified

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag (RESOLVED): Phase 2 research confirmed all admin ops use Zoho Mail API — no separate Directory API needed
- Research flag: Phase 5 needs attachment upload testing -- sparse docs, Content-Type gotchas reported by community
- Plan 03-02 runtime bug: AdminAuditSMTPLogsCmd.SearchBy enum panic ("enum value is only valid if it is either required or has a valid default value") — Kong validation issue, needs fix before audit commands are usable
